# Lady Victoria – A Mood-Based Chatbot

Lady Victoria is a playful Python chatbot with a formal, almost medieval British tone.  
She responds to user input while tracking “mood” on a scale from *0.1 (negative)* to *1.0 (positive)*.  
Her replies change based on the sentiment of the user’s messages.
